# live_shopping  

Welcome to our M2 project that we did with Bleu Reflet.  
To run the project in localhost, you can use the live_server module in VSCode. Otherwise, you will need the credentials to connect to Firebase (which are now handle by Bleu Reflet).  
You can take a look at the project in this address :  
https://webrtc-a7946.web.app/index.html (agent side)  
https://webrtc-a7946.web.app/client.html (client side)  

### Step :  
1. After allowing camera and microphone, the agent create a room. He is now waiting for a client.
2. After allowing camera and microphone, the client join a room. 
3. They are now connected to each other in P2P and they can interact (screenshare, switch microphone or camera).
